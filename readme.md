# Minizero
    A deep reinforcement learning based chess engine which follows the architecture of DeepMind's Alphazero

# Todo
    [x] Test if MCTS is working as expected
    [x] Stop inverting encoded board positions on position changes
    [x] Increase conv layers to 3
    [x] Optimize MCTS move generation
    [x] Add L2 regularization to model weights
    [x] Mask illegal moves child move counts
